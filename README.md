# FlexCoach API

FlexCoach API is a gym tracking and coaching platform built using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

## Project Outline

### Database Design using Entity Framework (EF)

- Define entities such as User, Coach, Workout, etc.

### ASP.NET Web API Setup

- Create a new ASP.NET Web API project in Visual Studio.
- Configure routing, controllers, and dependency injection.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement JWT authentication to secure API endpoints.
- Define roles (e.g., User, Coach) and authorize actions based on roles.

### API Endpoints

- Implement CRUD operations for entities (User, Workout, etc.).
- Develop endpoints for specific functionalities like starting a workout session

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

- Use DTOs to shape data returned by API endpoints for security and efficiency.

### Validation

- Implement validation for incoming requests (e.g., using Data Annotations or Fluent Validation).

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core: For building the API.
- Entity Framework Core: ORM for database operations.
- JWT Authentication: For securing endpoints.
- SQL Server/SQLite: Depending on database preference.

## Additional Considerations

- Error Handling: Implement global exception handling.
- Logging: Use logging frameworks like Serilog or NLog.
- Performance: Optimize queries using EF Core's capabilities.
